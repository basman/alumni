This is a simple alumni database for schools.

Written in PHP by Roman Hoog Antink (c) 2002-2013.

Its current language is German only.
It provides no login. Users authenticate by their date of birth.
It supports class lists with entries of teachers.

It supports tracking all former addresses of users, not just the latest one.
This can help organizing class reunions in case an entry is not up-to-date and
the people living at one of the former addresses are still in contact with or
know about the whereabouts of the class mate.

It does not provide photographs or bindings to other social networks.
